# cautious-radiology-prog-jaswal1p

I am creating this website to someday showcase my consulting and web development 
business, to help private practice and academic radiologits to set up their professional services for efficient flow, by using software tools to to precisly manage patient care and follow-ups.

Please note that I have intentionally not linked my resume and various speciality memberships to this site at this time, as this remains learning and early building enviroment.

I am also still working on making its display on cell-phones little bit better.
