# cautious-radiology-prog-jaswal1p

I am creating this website to someday showcase my consulting and web development 
business, to help private practice and academic radiologits to set up their practices by using software tools to make their workflow, patient info and follow-up management more efficient.

Please note that I have intentinally not linked my resume and various speciality membership
pages at this time as this is a learning and early building enviroment at this time.

I am also still working on making its display on cell-phones little bit better.
